# Web API prototype project
This repository stores a REST API project. It is a small prototype that is similar to a real project, that will be relevant for the back-end position. We use this prototype to ensure the knowledge and skills of potential candidates.

Please do not use more than max. a couple of hours on this. The most important is for us to see your understanding/thinking. We ask you to do the following:

1. Clone this repo and see how the application is working.
2. Review the code base from your knowledge to evaluate the quality of the code and how it could be improved.
3. Make some relevant changes and comment with your thoughts and explanations.
4. More overall thoughts/suggestions/idea for the code and architecture can be added below in this README.
5. Make a pull request with all your changes.
