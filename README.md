# Web API prototype project
This repository stores a REST API project. It is a small prototype that is similar to a real project, that will be relevant for the back-end position.

Below is a few tasks that we have prepared for you. We only expect you to spend a few hours on this â€“ not days. The most important is for us to get a little insight into your understanding/thinking. We ask you to do the following:

1. Clone this repo and see how the application is working.
2. Review the code base and evaluate the code and how it could be improved.
3. Make some relevant changes and comments with your thoughts and explanations.
4. More overall thoughts/suggestions/ideas for the code or architecture can be added below in this README.
5. Make a pull request with your changes.
